		   <h2> Scuba Diving 🤿 </h2>
		   <p>
I have been scuba diving since I was 16 years old with my parents and my brother, I spent my level 1 in Corsica and my dream is to one day dive in the Red Sea!

	  	<h2> Travelling ✈️ </h2>
		  <p>
Travelling is for me the key to happiness and means a lot to me. I went to Corsica for 10 years, to England many times to see my family, I also visited Italy, Spain several times, Sardinia, Turkey, Morocco, Martinique, Hong Kong and New York but the trip that left the most impression on me was my Road Trip on the West Side of the United States. Also, I hope that one day i'll be able to visit Japan and go on a safari in Kenya!

      <h2> Music 🎵 </h2>
		  <p>
Music takes a big place in my life. I’m always with my airpods, I wake up to music and I fall asleep to music and that, ever since I was a little girl. I listen to all styles of music, except maybe hardcore metal, but I’m not closed to this style of music if I like a song! If I had to quote some of my favorite artists I would say The Weeknd, Bruno Mars, Michael Jackson, George Michael, Doja Cat and many US rap artists of the 90/00’s.
